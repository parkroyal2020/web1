  Language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.

  <p>Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based,
  object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as
  possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere
  (WORA),[15] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
  support Java without the need for recompilation.[16] Java applications are
  typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
  regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is
  similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
